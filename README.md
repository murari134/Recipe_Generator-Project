# Recipe_Generator-Project
Building A Recipe Generator
🥘 Recipe Finder with Spoonacular API
This Python project allows users to input a list of available ingredients and fetches a suitable recipe from the Spoonacular API. It returns detailed recipe information including ingredients, steps, time required, and a link to the full recipe. Optionally, it also saves the recipe to a text file.

📌 Features
Input ingredients and fetch a matching recipe.
Shows:
Recipe title
Used and missing ingredients
Recipe image preview
Time required and servings
Step-by-step instructions
Optionally save the recipe to a .txt file.
🛠️ Requirements
Python 3.x
requests library
Install the dependency with:
 pip install requests
🔐 API Key
This project uses the Spoonacular API.
Create an account on Spoonacular.
Navigate to your dashboard and get your free API key.
Replace the placeholder key in the script:
     API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
     🚀 How to Run
Save the script as recipe_finder.py.
Run the script in terminal or any Python environment:
python recipe_finder.py
Enter a comma-separated list of ingredients when prompted:
What ingredients do you have? (Separate with commas):chicken, garlic, lemon
The script fetches and displays a matching recipe.
If you choose to save the recipe: [Want to save this recipe to a text file? (yes/no): yes}
A file named generated_recipe.txt will be created with the recipe details.
Recipe Finder Python code step by step to understand how it works.
🔍 Overview

The program:
Takes user-input ingredients.
Calls the Spoonacular API to find a matching recipe.
Displays the recipe title, image, ingredients, and instructions.
Optionally saves the recipe to a .txt file.
🧱 Code Explanation

✅ 1. Importing Required Module:
import requests
requests is used to make HTTP calls to the Spoonacular API.
🔐 2. Configuration:
 API_KEY = "# ← REPLACE THIS with your key"
 BASE_URL = "https://api.spoonacular.com"  
-API_KEY: Your access key to use the Spoonacular API.

BASE_URL: The base URL for all API endpoints.
🧾 3. Take Input from User:
user_input = input("What ingredients do you have? (Separate with commas): ")
-Asks the user to type in a comma-separated list of ingredients, e.g., "chicken, garlic, lemon".

🍽️ 4. Find Recipe Based on Ingredients:
find_recipe_url = f"{BASE_URL}/recipes/findByIngredients"
lookup_params = {
"ingredients": user_input,
"number": 1,
"ranking": 1,
"ignorePantry": True,
"apiKey": API_KEY}
URL for the API call to search for recipes.
number=1: Only fetches one recipe.
ranking=1: Prioritizes recipes that use the most ingredients you have.
ignorePantry=True: Ignores common pantry items like water, salt, etc.
search_result = requests.get(find_recipe_url, params=lookup_params)
Makes the actual API call.
🚨 5. Handle Errors:
if search_result.status_code != 200:
  print("Hmm, something went wrong:", search_result.json())
  exit(1)
If the API call fails, prints the error and exits the program.
🥇 6. Parse the First Recipe:
recipe_data = search_result.json()
if not recipe_data:
  print("Couldn't find any recipe with those ingredients.")
  exit()
If the list is empty, no recipe was found.
first_recipe = recipe_data[0]
print("\n=== Found a Recipe! ===")
print(f"Title: {first_recipe['title']}")
print(f"Used: {[item['name'] for item in first_recipe['usedIngredients']]}")
print(f"Missing: {[item['name'] for item in first_recipe['missedIngredients']]}")
print(f"Image Preview: {first_recipe['image']}")
-Shows basic recipe details including: - Used & missing ingredients - Image preview link

📋 7. Fetch Full Recipe Information:
recipe_id = first_recipe['id']
details_url = f"{BASE_URL}/recipes/{recipe_id}/information"
details_params = {
"includeNutrition": False,
"apiKey": API_KEY}
details_response = requests.get(details_url, params=details_params)
Uses the recipe ID to fetch full instructions, time, ingredients, servings, etc. ```python if details_response.status_code != 200: print("Ugh, failed to fetch full recipe info:", details_response.json()) exit()
Handles error if second API call fails.
📤 8. Display Full Recipe:
details = details_response.json()
print("\n=== Full Recipe Info ===")
print(f"Title: {details['title']}")
print(f"Time Required: {details['readyInMinutes']} mins")
print(f"Servings: {details['servings']}")
print(f"Link: {details['sourceUrl']}")
Displays title, time, servings, and a link to the full recipe. ```python print("\nIngredients Needed:") for ing in details['extendedIngredients']: print(f"- {ing['original']}")
Shows a nicely formatted ingredients list.
print("\nHow to Make It:")
if details.get('instructions'):
    print(details['instructions'])
else:
    print("No instructions were provided. Might be a good time to improvise!")
Displays instructions if available.
💾 9. Optionally Save to File:
save_choice = input("\nWant to save this recipe to a text file? (yes/no): ").strip().lower()
if save_choice == "yes":
  try:
      with open("generated_recipe.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
          f.write(f"Title: {details['title']}\n")
          f.write(f"Time Required: {details['readyInMinutes']} mins\n")
          f.write(f"Servings: {details['servings']}\n")
          f.write(f"Link: {details['sourceUrl']}\n\n")
          f.write("Ingredients:\n")
          for ing in details['extendedIngredients']:
              f.write(f"- {ing['original']}\n")
          f.write("\nInstructions:\n")
          f.write(details['instructions'] or "No instructions were provided.")
      print("✅ All done! Saved to 'generated_recipe.txt'")
  except Exception as e:
      print(f"Something went wrong while saving the file: {e}")
-If user says "yes", it writes the recipe details into a file named generated_recipe.txt.

Proper error handling in case file write fails.
✅ Conclusion

This is a clean, well-structured script for building a basic AI-powered recipe generator based on user input ingredients using a real-world API.
Let me know if you want enhancements like:
Showing multiple recipe options
Using a GUI (Tkinter)
Sending recipe via email
CLI tool version with flags (e.g., --save, --limit)
📂 Output Sample
=== Found a Recipe! ===

Title: Grilled Lemon Garlic Chicken
Used: ['chicken', 'garlic', 'lemon']
Missing: ['olive oil', 'rosemary']
Image Preview: https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/123456-312x231.jpg
Ingredients Needed:

2 boneless chicken breasts
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 lemon, juiced
2 tbsp olive oil
1 tsp rosemary
How to Make It:

Mix garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, and rosemary.
Marinate chicken for 15 mins.
Grill for 8-10 mins on each side.
🧠 Notes
Only one recipe is fetched ("number": 1) for simplicity. You can increase this number in the lookup_params.
ignorePantry=True will exclude common pantry items like salt, water, etc.
The script checks for possible API failures and informs the user.
